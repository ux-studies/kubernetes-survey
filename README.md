# Preferences for Kubernetes Tasks and Tools Survey

# The Research Gap

Developer surveys such as the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf) show that there is an increased usage of Kubernetes in production. However, these developer surveys do not ask which Kubernetes tools are preferred in practice. Understanding the software tools that are preferred by developers and whether preference depends on the programming task at hand, is important for informing the future design and development of these tools. Therefore, we wrote a survey to help address this gap and ask Kubernetes developers what their preference is among three tool modalities: Command Line Interface (CLI), Graphical Console, and IDE, and whether their tool preference varies across three programming task types: CRUD, debugging, and monitoring.

# You Can Help

Good candidates for participating in this survey include those that have any Kubernetes experience, anywhere from a beginner to an expert level. We welcome participants with experience using any form of Kubernetes tools. Furthermore, we encourage others involved within open source Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for [CLIs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cli/README.md) and [Usability](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-usability) to promote the survey and recruit more participants within the Kubernetes community. We are still recruiting survey participants with any experience using Kubernetes in their work.

This quick, 2-minute survey is still open to willing participants. Your responses are important to help understand the combinations of tasks and tools preferred by Kubernetes developers. We appreciate any feedback you may have on our survey. Please reach out via email to ccoleman at ucsd.edu with any feedback or questions.
